            <p>We are <strong>rentals.com</strong>, Canada's number one location to find your rental house. We are here to assist you 24/7. Our owner got the idea of starting the business when he came to Canada. For four months he was not able to find a house. If he found a house, it was not for lease and there were lots of problems. There were hundreds of rental websites but none like us. We also help people to get the rent low. Special discounts for students. Moreover, we have leasing agents who are there to help you all day. Even when the owner tries to commit fraud, we will help you. We only publish trusted housing.</p>
